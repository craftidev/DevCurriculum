# DevCurriculum intro
This is a portfolio in the form of a WebApp to
showcase personnal coding skills.

It uses GitHub for the static part (HTML/CSS/JS).

And an API for the server code (Java/Python/PHP/PostgreSQL).

Front/Back end are connected using AJAX.

### Static
#### HTML/CSS/JS
- A responsive webdesign of a resume.
- A JavaScript Game: Pong, but with collision on DOM elements of the resume, creating shrapnels.
### Server
#### PHP/PostgreSQL
- Authentification.
- CRUD.
- Data/App security.
#### Java
- Create an API linked to the DB.
- Demonstrate object-oriented programming skills.
- Showcase Java-based web service development.
#### Python
- Fetching data on this GitHub.
- Data analysis on git history.
- Graph representation and filters.
### Integration, AJAX & CORS
- Explore methods for integrating front/back-end components using AJAX.
- Ensure proper handling of cross-origin requests.
